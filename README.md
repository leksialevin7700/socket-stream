## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instantly send and receive messages with the power of Socket.IO.
- **Delivery & Read Receipts**: Know exactly when your message is delivered and read.
- **User Presence**: See who's online and available to chat.
- **Typing Indicators**: Get notified when someone is typing a reply.
- **Notification Support**: Browser notifications for new messages.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The project is built using a modern, full-stack JavaScript ecosystem, combining the following tools and frameworks:

- **React** (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) for the frontend UI
- **React Router** for navigation and routing
- **Socket.IO** (client & server) for real-time, bidirectional communication
- **Axios** for HTTP API requests from the frontend
- **Jest & React Testing Library** for frontend testing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the backend server and REST APIs
- **MongoDB** (with **Mongoose** ODM) for persistent data storage
- **CORS & Body-Parser** middleware for secure and structured API handling
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication (implied from typical structure)
- **Babel/Webpack/ESLint** (via Create React App) for code transformation and linting
- **Environment Variables** (supported in CRA and Node for configuration)

## üí° How It Works

This app lets you chat with another user in real time, just like your favorite messaging platforms. When you send a message, it's stored in a database and immediately delivered if your friend is online. You'll see when your message is delivered and when it's read. If your chat partner is typing, you'll know. Even if you close your browser, your chat history is safe and waiting for you when you return.
